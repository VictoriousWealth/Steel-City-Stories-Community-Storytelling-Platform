        <p>Since human-beings can not properly understand 
          both thoughts & emotions of a vast amount of humans around them, 
          we need to collect opinions on various topics and after careful consideration - do something about that (or not).

          Department to co-create student-led change based on student feedback. Academic Reps volunteer
