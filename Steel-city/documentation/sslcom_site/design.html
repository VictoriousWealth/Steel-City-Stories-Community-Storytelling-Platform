      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> 
        I have tried a host of different color contrasts and came to the conclusion that there is 
        a better way of achieving two goals I had - making an unusual website that is stylish and quite accessible.
         Ultimately, I came to the idea of white rounded islands on an art-based background that symbolizes 
         the bridge of communication between students and staff.
         The background symbolizes the bridge betweeen students and staff.

        <img src="./images/site_map.jpg" alt="Site Map">
        <figcaption>Site Map sketch</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The site map has the Home page as a root and all other pages are childs that are connected between each other via menus.
        I drew this in multiple rows to show that there are the main menu and the footer menu.

      <h2>Design reasoning</h2>
      <p>
        I have used three breakpoints when creating this website: mobile (under 550px) -> narrow (under 900px) -> desktop (above 900px).
        The main difference is between the mobile and the narrow layouts. I slightly adjusted usual values for the breakpoints
        (500, 1000) to these ones since my website looks better compared to using the standard ones.
        <br>
        The tweakpoints are font sizes, height & radius of the menu buttons, and radius of the "islands"
         - sections of content. I was slightly adjusting the fonts to make them look better when transitioning
          from mobile to the narrow screen. On the other hand, I changed the height of the buttons:
           on the mobile, they are large to avoid misclicks with the fingers, and smaller (relative to the screen width)
            on the desktops. It is important to note that I used flexboxes to make my content spread out aesthetically 
            on the desktop, whereas on the mobile the content islands go one by one in the column.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Overall, Home, About, and Memmbers pages share the same approach: same navigation, footer,
         title, and content spread out on the desktops using flexboxes. I did not use flexboxes where
          it is important to allocate all the width to the image, like diagrams. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The case where there is not a lot of content - adding a sidebar may be not the best approach.
        Therefore, Meetings, and all the footer pages (except the Test page) have no flexboxes. Otherwise, the page may look empty on the desktop.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Menu System</h2>
      <p>
        Buttons as elements of an unordered flex list have been used to create the navigation menu.
        This approach allows for easier & more efficient customization than using links, whilst the buttons being a part of an
         unordered flex list spreads out the items, and centers them. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This approach is simple, but allows for easier adjusments for wider screens (e.g. reducing the height), and is responsive.
        I used specific classes to customize the navigation buttons and menu.
